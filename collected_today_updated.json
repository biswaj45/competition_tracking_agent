The $19.99 per month service is designed for individuals and aims to simplify the company’s consumer lineup while offering more value than separate plans.\n\nThe new plan combines existing Microsoft 365 Family features with what was previously offered in Copilot Pro. It includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook, all with Copilot built directly inside. The package also includes 1TB of cloud storage, Microsoft Defender security, and exclusive AI features like Researcher, Analyst, Office Agent, and Agent Mode.\n\nThe plan offers the company’s highest Copilot usage limits, covering AI-powered image generation, podcasts, voice commands, and deep research.\n\nYusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, called the plan “our most powerful AI and productivity subscription for individuals” in a blog post.\n\nThe move follows Microsoft’s push to integrate its Copilot AI assistant into daily workflows, and it comes at a time when tech giants are racing to monetize generative AI tools.\n\nCompeting with ChatGPT Plus\n\nThe $19.99 price signals that Microsoft is clearly putting 365 Premium head-to-head with OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus, which costs the same but does not include productivity apps.\n\n“It’s really going to be our most powerful AI and productivity subscription for any individual. It brings together our trusted collection of productivity apps with Copilot built-in, along with our highest Copilot usage limits and exclusive features,” Gareth Oystryk, senior director of marketing for Copilot Pro and Microsoft 365, told The Verge.\n\nMicrosoft is banking on the appeal of having Office apps plus AI in one package as a stronger deal than ChatGPT Plus. The introduction of 365 Premium also means the end of Copilot Pro sales; however, existing Copilot Pro customers will not be automatically upgraded to Premium, but they will be able to switch.\n\n“As part of this simplification, we’ll no longer sell Copilot Pro—Copilot Pro subscribers can switch to Microsoft 365 Premium for more value,” Mehdi wrote. “Customers with both Microsoft 365 Personal or Family and Copilot Pro can switch to Microsoft 365 Premium and get everything they had before while enjoying meaningful savings.”\n\nBeyond Premium, Microsoft is extending higher AI usage limits to its Personal ($9.99/month) and Family ($12.99/month) subscribers at no additional cost. Meanwhile, Microsoft also announced that students around the world can claim one year of Microsoft 365 Personal for free, provided they register with a valid university email by Oct. 31, 2025, expanding an earlier US-only offer.\n\nMicrosoft has also launched its new Security Store, which features security solutions and agents that work with Microsoft security products, including the Copilot AI.\n\nSubscribe to the Microsoft Weekly Newsletter\n\nBe your company's Microsoft insider by reading these Windows and Office tips, tricks, and cheat sheets.

      "content_scraped": "When cybersecurity stakes are high and complexity is the norm, Microsoft doesn’t just participate, it excels with Microsoft Defender XDR—built to anticipate, disrupt, and outpace modern cyberthreats. We are excited to announce that Microsoft has been named a Leader in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Extended Detection and Response Software 2025 Vendor Assessment (doc #US52997325, September 2025). Read the complete IDC MarketScape: Worldwide XDR Software 2025 report.\n\nComprehensive visibility across the enterprise\n\nDefender XDR has the broadest signal coverage across the enterprise spanning endpoints, identities, email and collaboration tools, software as a service (SaaS) apps, cloud workloads, and data security—which enables security leaders to consolidate visibility, automate response, and outperform siloed tools. It combines native capabilities in threat detection, prevention, and response backed by AI-powered automation, rich telemetry, and seamless security information and event management (SIEM) integration to deliver a comprehensive and proactive defense strategy for modern enterprises. But Microsoft’s advantage goes beyond coverage. As one of the Big Three public cloud providers—and the originator of widely adopted platforms like Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Entra ID—Microsoft has unparalleled insight into the very technologies it secures.\n\nIDC MarketScape vendor analysis model is designed to provide an overview of the competitive fitness of technology and suppliers in a given market. The research methodology utilizes a rigorous scoring methodology based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria that results in a single graphical illustration of each supplier’s position within a given market. The Capabilities score measures supplier product, go-to-market, and business execution in the short-term. The Strategy score measures alignment of supplier strategies with customer requirements in a three- to five-year timeframe. Supplier market share is represented by the size of the icons.\n\nDriving AI innovation in cybersecurity\n\nMicrosoft also stands out for its use of AI in cybersecurity through Microsoft Security Copilot. First introduced in March 2023 with generative AI capabilities, these digital assistants have evolved into a suite of autonomous AI agents announced in 2025, each designed to support specific use cases such as triaging user-reported phishing emails. This agentic approach enhances operational efficiency and empowers security teams with intelligent, task-specific automation. In fact, the phishing triage agent examines thousands of alerts each day—typically within 15 minutes of detection—which saves time, accelerates threat response, and allows security operations center (SOC) teams to focus on more meaningful tasks.\n\nComplementing this agentic approach, IDC specifically highlighted Microsoft Defender’s automatic attack disruption, an AI-powered capability that disrupts in-progress cyberattacks like ransomware by containing compromised assets to prevent lateral movement—often within an average of just three minutes. Together, these innovations show how Microsoft is redefining the modern SOC to infuse AI throughout standard SOC workflows and rapidly respond to sophisticated cyberattacks.\n\nMicrosoft provides a full life cycle offering from preemptive and prevention technologies to detection and response. —IDC MarketScape: Worldwide XDR Software 2025 report\n\nPreemptive posture that reduces risk\n\nIn their report, IDC shared that one key Microsoft strength lies in its ability to unify proactive defense with intelligent response. Defender XDR natively integrates exposure management, attack surface reduction, secure configuration monitoring, and data loss prevention—giving security teams the tools to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before they’re exploited. This preemptive posture and built-in attack disruption not only reduces risk but also enhances the fidelity of alerts, enabling faster, more accurate threat detection.\n\nDefender script analysis and threat hunting\n\nSophisticated cyberattacks often evade detection using cloaked scripts and PowerShell commands. Defender XDR includes built-in script analysis, allowing analysts to inspect and classify scripts without external tools—reducing complexity and accelerating response. And for deeper threat hunting, Defender XDR supports Kusto Query Language (KQL), enabling analysts to parse telemetry, discover patterns, and identify outliers. Novice users can leverage a guided user interface experience to build and customize queries with ease while building their skillset.\n\nSeamless integration and correlation between SIEM and XDR\n\nIDC also noted that what sets Microsoft apart is its seamless correlation between SIEM and XDR, allowing insights from threat actor behavior and anomalies to flow across platforms without requiring customers to deploy both. With all this, plus powerful visualizations, KQL-based threat hunting, and deep identity threat detection, Microsoft delivers a strongly competitive, comprehensive, and adaptive security operations experience.\n\nLearn more\n\nRead the complete IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Extended Detection and Response (XDR) Software 2025 report and visit the Microsoft Defender XDR webpage to learn how you can elevate your security with unified visibility, investigation, and response across the cyberattack chain with an industry-leading XDR solution.\n\nTo learn more about Microsoft Security solutions, visit our website.

      "content_scraped": "We love companies that produce cash. Lots of cash. How about 2% of market capitalization? Microsoft’s stock is worth $3.9 trillion and produced $71.6 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2025, about 1.8% of market capitalization. On a per-share basis, that’s $9.60 of free cash flow for a $520 stock. What’s not to love? This cash piles up on the balance sheet, can be reinvested, and fuels buybacks. Microsoft’s operating cash flow margin sits at 48.3%, generating $136 billion from $282 billion in revenue. Net income? A staggering $102 billion – a roughly 36% net margin, marking the first time Microsoft crossed the $100 billion profit threshold. The balance sheet is fortress-like, with $95 billion in cash versus $61 billion in debt, representing a strong net cash position. At the same time, Microsoft returned $37 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in the last twelve months alone. See – Why Microsoft Stock Is A Shareholder’s Paradise? – for more details.\n\nWhile Microsoft stock has had a strong year, surging 24% and outpacing the NASDAQ’s 18% gain, the key question now is: Is there still room for Microsoft stock to grow?\n\nA deep dive into the company’s fundamentals suggests the answer is yes, as growth is rapidly accelerating.\n\nMicrosoft reported robust results for fiscal year 2025 with revenue and operating income rising in mid to high teens. A major driver of this performance is the Intelligent Cloud segment. Azure alone surpassed $75 billion in annual revenue, growing at a remarkable 34% year-over-year. Artificial Intelligence (AI) services are a significant tailwind, contributing 19 percentage points of that growth.\n\nThe company is fueled by several massive, long-term growth drivers—chief among them, the proliferation of its AI offerings. These factors are expected to propel the stock to much higher levels, potentially doubling from current levels to levels past $1,000. We will explore these specific growth drivers in more detail. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like Microsoft, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – What’s Next For CoreWeave Stock?\n\nSeveral Big Growth Drivers\n\nAI and Cloud Dominance: Microsoft is investing an estimated $70 billion in AI infrastructure during fiscal 2026, building the world’s most powerful AI datacenters across 400+ locations globally. Azure revenue reached $75 billion in fiscal 2025 with 34% growth, driven by both traditional cloud migrations and explosive AI workload adoption. Microsoft Cloud revenue hit $186 billion annually, up 27%, with the contribution of AI services on the rise. The company’s integrated AI stack – from infrastructure to applications like Copilot – is already boosting revenue growth, with broader enterprise adoption expected in the coming years. Enterprise Software and Productivity: The Productivity and Business Processes segment generated $116.5 billion in fiscal 2025, growing 16%. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 16%, while LinkedIn revenue grew 8%. Dynamics 365 surged 19% as customers migrate to cloud-based business applications. Microsoft is benefiting from higher pricing for its products by integrating AI-enhanced features that seamlessly improve existing user workflows. This will help in revenue acceleration. Gaming and Consumer Technology: Despite Xbox hardware declining 22%, Xbox content and services revenue jumped 13%, demonstrating the shift toward higher-margin subscription and cloud gaming models. The More Personal Computing segment contributed $54 billion in fiscal 2025, with Windows licenses and search advertising showing steady growth driven by AI integration across consumer products.\n\nHow Microsoft Stock Reaches $1,000\n\nLet’s run the numbers. Microsoft generated $281.7 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025, with accelerating growth momentum. With AI adoption driving sustained 17% annual revenue growth and margin expansion from operational leverage, sales can reach $450 billion by 2028. Microsoft’s operating margins are projected to expand to 50% as high-margin AI services scale and operational efficiency improves. That translates to roughly $225 billion in operating income, or about $180 billion in net income after taxes.\n\nWith continued share repurchases reducing the float, share count could trend toward 7.2 billion shares. That would translate into EPS of about $25 per share by 2028. Now let’s consider valuation. While Microsoft currently trades at 38x trailing earnings (based on fiscal 2025 results), its AI monetization story supports a premium valuation. Given Microsoft’s strong growth, superior margins, and solid cash flow generation, we do not foresee any significant compression in multiples over the next three years.\n\nImplied Share Price:\n\nEven a conservative multiple of 30x—reflecting a mature AI growth story while maintaining reasonable valuation discipline—implies a $750 share price.\n\nIf the company maintains its current multiple of around 40x, the implied share price would exceed $1,000, representing a 2x growth from current levels.\n\nWhat Are The Risks?\n\nDespite Microsoft’s promising outlook, potential risks could hinder the stock from doubling. The most significant concern is the normalization of AI spending, where businesses become more cautious about starting new Azure projects, suggesting the current pace of investment may not be indefinitely sustainable. Furthermore, increased competition from Google, Amazon, and emerging players could pressure Microsoft’s AI pricing power and market share gains.\n\nSee, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMicrosoft’s investment case is compelling. Record cash generation of $72 billion and an impregnable balance sheet fund both aggressive AI infrastructure investments and consistent shareholder returns, while diversified exposure across cloud, AI, enterprise software, and gaming reduces risk and positions the company for sustained long-term growth. The projected $70 billion AI infrastructure investment creates competitive advantages that magnify market share gains, with additional upside potential from AI-driven margin expansion while maintaining accelerating growth. That said, investors should carefully weigh the risks before investing in Microsoft.\n\nInvest with Trefis Market-Beating Portfolios\n\nSee all Trefis Price Estimates"

      "content_scraped": "Channel Insider content and product recommendations are editorially independent. We may make money when you click on links to our partners. Learn More\n\nMicrosoft’s overhaul of its Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program is now live, reshaping who can sell through each partner route and how orders and customer agreements must be handled. The changes combine revised revenue thresholds, stricter Partner of Record (POR) validation, updated Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) attestation, and enhanced security expectations.\n\nWhat to know about the new CSP structure, rules, and more\n\nThe shift, first announced in May, is designed to move the channel from ad-hoc enrollments to a smaller set of partners with verified operational and security capabilities. The changes will also prompt a practical reassessment of how MSPs and distributors route deals and plan multi-year offers. The list below offers a quick summary of the changes:\n\nDirect-bill partners: must show $1,000,000 USD trailing-12-month (TTM) CSP revenue at the Partner Global Account (PGA) level; annual reassessments begin Oct. 1, 2025.\n\nmust show trailing-12-month (TTM) CSP revenue at the Partner Global Account (PGA) level; annual reassessments begin Oct. 1, 2025. Distributors (indirect providers): nomination and business vetting are required, plus $30,000,000 USD TTM billed CSP revenue per authorized region .\n\nnomination and business vetting are required, plus TTM billed CSP revenue . Indirect resellers (PLA-level): a $1,000 USD TTM minimum at the reseller tenant (PLA) level; failure triggers remediation/deauthorization pathways.\n\na TTM minimum at the reseller tenant (PLA) level; failure triggers remediation/deauthorization pathways. Solutions-partner and incentive alignment: Incentive eligibility and certain program benefits will be tied to Solutions Partner designations and capability scores, with the new revenue/security thresholds taking effect on October 1, 2025.\n\n“For Direct CSPs specifically, the margins aren’t what they used to be with these new requirements. The level of effort and investment now required to maintain Direct status has significantly increased, offering fewer advantages than it once did. We’re making sure these partners fully understand what staying Direct now demands, so they can make informed decisions about what’s best for their business,” said Alexandre Laflamme, Sherweb’s programs and sales incentives manager.\n\n“While Indirect CSPs face fewer requirements, they still must earn 25 Partner Capability Score (PCS) points to remain eligible for incentives—which can be achieved through sales performance or certifications. We’re working with these partners to ensure they’re completing those certifications and reaching those sales requirements to maximize their incentives,” Laflamme continued.\n\nAPI and UI checks added as Microsoft pushes partners towards the future\n\nThe program enforces several operational changes that directly affect sales workflows. Effective as of September 1, Partner Location Account (PLA) API and UI checks prevent distributors from assigning POR to resellers who are not authorized or compliant, which will surface mapping and authorization errors at the time of order.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft will block net-new customer orders on Oct. 7, 2025, unless the customer has accepted the MCA directly or the partner attests via a new enhanced attestation API; the existing API and Partner Center UX attestation paths will be retired, and the MCA bulk-attestation tool will be phased to read-only and then retired in January 2026.\n\nThose changes mean partners must either integrate the new API or adopt a customer-facing acceptance step to avoid order failures.\n\nMicrosoft will run automated assessments that review billing, provisioning, compliance, support, and security as part of the FY26 authorization process. That elevates partner operational hygiene from recommended best practice to a gating condition for selling.\n\nVoices from the channel: Sherweb pledges to help partners adjust as needed\n\nDistributors and other groups have stepped up to walk Microsoft partners through the changes. Sherweb launched a program and a consulting practice recently to help its MSPs and reseller partners make the most out of the program.\n\n“The level of expertise that Sherweb brings is unmatched. I’m constantly amazed at how intimately they understand the Microsoft landscape,” Keith Harris, director of technology at Kelley Create, told us. “We would struggle to build our own expertise and keep current with the constant changes coming at us from Microsoft. That’s if we could even identify talent who would want to spend their days deciphering Microsoft’s maze of programs and terminology; that takes a special person to want to do that!”\n\n“Regular health checks with experts at Sherweb really help to keep us on track and understand what to focus on. And even more impressive is that they really simplify the complexity and make it almost a paint by numbers exercise for us to follow,” Harris added.\n\n“With the Microsoft CSP program evolving so quickly, it wasn’t just a question of whether we understood the changes, it was about making sure we were approaching them the right way and adapting our business accordingly,” said Eric Veenendaal, founder and CEO of Convverge, in a statement. “Sherweb provided us with their insights, validated what we were already doing and recommended adjustments where it made sense. Their perspective has provided tremendous value to Convverge.”\n\nSherweb’s MSPs can access the following:\n\nGet clear guidance on program changes : Sherweb makes complex MAICPP updates manageable by explaining changes in real time and in plain language.

Sherweb also helps reduce internal costs with insights into licensing benefits packages, demo environments and on-prem services.\n\n“As the Microsoft CSP program evolves, our top priority is making this transition easier for MSPs by helping them to understand and manage each new requirement, so they can stay compliant, protect their margins and continue delivering top-quality service to their customers,” said Laflamme.\n\nHow to move forward: strategic moves that preserve customers and revenue\n\nIf you still need a few steps to get started, download our checklist below as you weigh what the program might mean for your business.\n\nFriction, consolidation, and other ongoing trends likely to accelerate in the short term\n\nThe rules are likely to accelerate consolidation among marginal resellers, increase distributor manage-and-remediate activity, and shift some SMB customers into bundled offerings or multiyear agreements. For customers, the visible short-term effect may be friction on new orders or renewals where partners have not updated PLA mappings or attestation flows. Partners that simplify the customer acceptance path and offer clear multi-year value propositions can reduce this friction and retain their clients’ long-term investments in Microsoft solutions."

      "content_scraped": "Microsoft has introduced the Microsoft Agent Framework, an open-source SDK and runtime for building, orchestrating, and deploying AI agents and multi-agent workflows, with full framework support for .NET and Python.\n\nIntroduced October 1 and available on GitHub, the Agent Framework is designed to let developers build everything from simple chat agents to complex multi-agent workflows with graph-based orchestration, Microsoft said. Developers can experiment locally with the framework and then deploy to the Azure AI Foundry for AI apps, with observability, durability, and compliance built-in. Multi-agent systems can be built connecting Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and other agent platforms.\n\nMicrosoft said that the Microsoft Agent Framework brings together and extends the ideas from the Semantic Kernel and AutoGen projects, and that developers currently using these projects will find the transition to the Agent Framework straightforward. The Agent Framework supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol and features an OpenAPI-first design and cloud-agnostic runtime. As a result, the Agent Framework enables the following capabilities, according to Microsoft:"

      "content_scraped": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nA barrage of blog posts by OpenAI was seen by the software industry as a shot across the bow.\n\nWith its own AI-powered sales, support, and contract tools, the company could go from powering the software-as-a-service (SaaS) market to competing with it.\n\nFor years, OpenAI has provided AI infrastructure, selling tools that software players could build on. Now it's embedding AI directly into its everyday internal processes, such as sales, support, and document analysis. That makes it both a partner and a potential rival — a dynamic that could reshape the software landscape dominated by giants like Salesforce.\n\nSoftware rivals are already taking a hit on the stock market. HubSpot shares plunged 10% on Tuesday, while DocuSign slumped 12% and ZoomInfo fell 6%. Salesforce fell more than 3%, leaving it down 28% for the year so far.\n\nFrom model maker to app builder\n\nGiancarlo Lionetti, OpenAI's chief commercial officer, framed the shift in a new \"OpenAI on OpenAI\" series posted on the startup's website on Monday, where the company showcased software that it actually uses to run its own operations:\n\nInbound Sales Assistant: Answers questions from prospective customers in real time and routes qualified leads to salespeople.\n\nGTM Assistant: A Slack-based companion that prepares sales calls, pulls customer histories, and answers product questions instantly.\n\nDocuGPT: Parses contracts into searchable data, flagging unusual terms for finance teams.\n\nResearch and Support Agents: Handle support tickets and improve service quality.\n\nSoftware vendors in the crosshairs\n\nOpenAI has not launched these tools as publicly available products. However, each of these applications could pose a threat to established software vendors, according to analysts.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n\"These blog posts could be a precursor to OpenAI launching new SaaS products to sell within its ChatGPT Enterprise platform,\" Derrick Wood, a tech analyst at TD Cowen, wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday.\n\nWall Street has already been on edge about this, after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted \"entering the fast fashion era of SaaS very soon\" in August. CFO Sarah Friar also didn't hold back when asked about this at a recent investor conference.\n\n\"Why wouldn't I code the kind of software that is exactly what OpenAI needs? Not what Goldman needs or any other company needs,\" she said. \"I think that is going to change the whole face of how software is developed.\"\n\nRBC analysts wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday that they see a \"competitive overhang\" for certain software companies, citing product overlap with software providers that help manage customer relationships and contracts — the core offering of Salesforce.\n\nThey highlighted which companies could be most exposed if OpenAI releases some of these tools as products. Some customers may not want to pay extra for such features if OpenAI's products can do the same thing.\n\nHubSpot and Salesforce: They build software to manage inbound sales and customer relationships, and OpenAI just built a rival for itself.\n\nZoomInfo: Its sales and marketing tools for lead intelligence and routing overlap heavily with OpenAI's internal assistants.\n\nDocuSign: OpenAI's internal DocuGPT tool could threaten to erode the value of DocuSign's contract analysis features.\n\nThreat or opportunity?\n\nFor software companies, partnering with OpenAI could boost sales conversion rates and speed up deal closings. Competing head-on could mean less revenue.\n\nPricing would be pivotal. If OpenAI licenses its agents per seat, vendors like HubSpot or DocuSign could feel real pressure. If it leans on charging by usage, integration may be the smarter path, according to analysts.\n\nEither way, the message is clear: AI is no longer just an add-on feature. It's the new foundation for sales, support, and finance.\n\nOpenAI may not release these tools as software products. And the startup insists this is about more human expertise, rather than replacing it. By incorporating the expertise of top salespeople or contract lawyers into AI systems, companies can spread best practices across their teams.\n\nOpenAI said its in-house technology saved its employees time so they could spend more time with customers. The startup's support reps shifted from processing tickets to designing systems. Finance teams slashed contract review times.\n\nThe company is betting that this blend of craft and code will define the next frontier of enterprise software.\n\nOpenAI is no longer just a supplier of AI. It's now a potential SaaS competitor in its own right.\n\nUpdate, Oct. 2, 2025 — This story was updated to make clear that OpenAI has not released its internal AI workplace tools as publicly available software products."

      "content_scraped": "Fresh off a $6.6 billion share sale that made it the world's most valuable private company, OpenAI's TikTok-style video app, powered by its new artificial intelligence model, Sora 2, is going viral.\n\nDespite the gated release that requires an invite code, the video creation tool has already shot to the top of Apple 's App Store and sparked a wave of deepfakes, including a viral clip of CEO Sam Altman shoplifting GPUs.\n\nInternally, the rollout has reignited a long-running debate inside OpenAI about how to balance safety with creative freedom.\n\nA person familiar with internal strategy at the company said leadership views strict guardrails as essential, but also worries about stifling creativity or being perceived as censoring too much.\n\nThat tension remains unresolved.\n\nOpenAI's culture has long favored speed, often shipping new tools ahead of rivals and letting the public adapt in real time.\n\nOne former employee, who asked not to be named to discuss internal matters, told CNBC that during their tenure, OpenAI leadership had a pattern of prioritizing fast launches. That strategy was on full display after China's DeepSeek released a powerful model at the end of last year that was cheaper and faster to build than anything out of Silicon Valley.\n\nOpenAI responded within weeks, debuting two new models in what was widely viewed as a defensive move to preserve its lead.\n\nBut OpenAI has a key advantage: Its growing institutional muscle.\n\nOnce a scrappy research lab in San Francisco's Mission District, the company has since become more structured, enabling it to spin up cross-functional teams more quickly and accelerate the development and deployment cycles for products like Sora.\n\nOpenAI said Sora includes multiple layers of safeguards meant to prevent unsafe content from being generated, using prompt filtering and output moderation across video frames and audio transcripts. It bans explicit content, terrorist propaganda, and material promoting self-harm. The app also uses watermarks and bans likeness impersonation.\n\nBut some users have already found ways to skirt those protections.\n\nSora 2, the AI model powering OpenAI's app, is a sharp improvement over the first version. The new system generates longer, more coherent clips that look strikingly real.\n\nMultiple viral videos feature Altman after he granted permission for his likeness to be used on the platform, while others depict popular cartoon characters like Pikachu and SpongeBob SquarePants in unsettling roles.\n\nThe content has fueled criticism that OpenAI is once again moving faster than its own guardrails. Its use of copyrighted material — unless rights holders opt out — is consistent with the company's current policy, though that approach is being challenged in court.\n\nAltman has brushed off concerns, saying in a post on X that Sora is as much about transparency — showing the public what the technology can do — as it is about building commercial momentum to fund OpenAI's broader ambitions around artificial general intelligence.\n\nThe launch comes amid intensifying competition. Meta rolled out Vibes last week, a new short-form AI video feed inside its Meta AI app. Google has Veo 3, while ByteDance and Alibaba have also debuted rival systems.\n\nOpenAI, meanwhile, just committed to fresh spending of $850 billion, deepening its push into infrastructure and next-gen models."

The sale pushed OpenAI’s total valuation to $500 billion, the highest ever achieved by a privately held company. Purchasers included SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Thrive Capital, MGX, and T. Rowe Price, the report said.\n\nThe sale was not a conventional funding round, as the cash went to individuals holding shares or options in OpenAI rather than the company’s own coffers. Still, it’s a powerful retention tool for the company, which has faced significant pressure from Meta’s newly revitalized AI lab. This summer, Meta poached at least seven top engineers from OpenAI, often luring them away with multimillion-dollar signing bonuses.\n\nOpenAI’s most recent funding round came in August, when it completed a $40 billion fundraise at a $300 billion valuation. SoftBank, Thrive, T. Rowe Price, and Dragoneer were also investors in that round, as well as private equity firms like Blackstone and TPG, and major venture capitalists like Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe sale is also a reminder of OpenAI’s ability to raise cash as needed — a particularly important resource given the company’s ambitious infrastructure plans. OpenAI has committed to spending $300 billion on Oracle Cloud Services over the next five years, a sum that vastly outstrips its current revenue or reserves. However, the powerful momentum of the company’s fundraising suggests it’s not as outlandish as standard arithmetic would indicate. In September, Nvidia announced a plan to invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a strategic infrastructure partnership.\n\nThe new sale comes just weeks after a non-binding agreement between OpenAI and Microsoft, which many saw as paving the way for OpenAI’s conversion into a for-profit entity. But OpenAI’s conversion has not yet been confirmed in court, and the new sales could cause significant complications if the conversion fails to proceed as planned.\n\nOpenAI continues to develop and launch products at a blistering pace, releasing its latest Sora 2 video model and accompanying social media feed earlier this week. The company reported $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, while burning through $2.5 billion in cash."

      "content_scraped": "For a company that reportedly has no plans to advertise, OpenAI has laid yet another brick in the foundation of what could be an ad business. On Monday, the tech behemoth launched Instant Checkout, an in-app shopping feature.\n\nIronically, commerce and marketing experts are less interested in what Instant Checkout means for OpenAI’s ad roadmap, and more interested in what it signals about agentic commerce, product discovery and zero-click search, six marketers told Digiday.\n\nConsider it a sign of the times: product discovery is moving from traditional search engines and marketplaces and toward AI-powered conversations. AI chat bots are expected to become the next brand awareness battleground.\n\n“It’s like Google and SEO all over again. How do you basically trick the system to make sure [your brand] shows up,” said Martin Kristiseter, CEO of Digital Remedy, a performance marketing company.\n\nOpenAI’s Instant Checkout feature — which allows users to search, shop and purchase within ChatGPT — was less a matter of if and more a matter of when, given more shoppers are starting their online search with AI chatbots. To put some numbers to it, 68% of shoppers across the world have used AI tools like ChatGPT to shop, according to a report published by creative agency VML. Other large language models have similar offerings, including Perplexity’s Buy with Pro functionality, which rolled out late last year and Microsoft Copilot’s Merchant program.\n\nBut ad spend hasn’t started to shift in response to these tools — at least not yet, agency execs say. There’s a bigger fear of missing out and being late to the AI hype train than there is expectations around incremental growth.\n\n“It’s definitely interesting and we are getting client questions about it already,” said Mike Feldman, svp of commerce at Flywheel. He later added, “Like much of AI, it’s a bit of a wait and see with lots and lots of potential for disruption.”\n\nMarketers aren’t so convinced by Instant Checkout\n\nInstant Checkout is in a nascent stage with limited merchants, a clunky user experience and it’s unclear how much insight merchants and their ad agency partners will have into things like brand sentiment and product listing rankings, according to two marketing execs Digiday spoke with for this piece. OpenAI highlighted in an announcement that “data sharing is minimal — only the information required to complete the order is shared with the merchant.”\n\nMarketers question whether brand or performance dollars should be spent to test and learn, how AI chatbots rank products to show to shoppers, what information will be available in regards to search queries, and if enough consumers will start their search with AI chatbots to make any dollars spent worth it.\n\nWhat is clear is that AIO and GEO are becoming a new race, hinged on brands having a strong web presence to show up in an AI chatbot.\n\n“It’s not a matter of: how do I get set up so that ChatGPT recommends my product and that I can sell my product directly in there? But how does ChatGPT see me as a brand overall on the web…” said Zubin Mowlavi, evp of commerce at Vayner Media.\n\nThere’s already an appetite and interest from clients regarding agentic AI and AI commerce, according to four agency execs (although budgets and specific strategies are still in the works). However, it’s entirely feasible for agentic AI to be shelved in the next 12-18 months as the bell curve goes through the trough of disillusionment. Gartner predicts more than 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by the end of 2027.\n\nAs Simon Poulton, evp of innovation and growth at Tinuiti, puts it, “Right now, there’s just curiosity across the board. A lot of folks are, frankly, just keeping up with drinking the fire hoses as they’re going.”"

Today, let's see how the rest of the world is reacting.\n\nIt has been a momentous week for OpenAI. In addition to Sora, the company introduced commerce in ChatGPT, parental controls, and its first extended ad campaign.

Despite requiring a (scarce) invitation to use, Sora is the No. 3 most-downloaded app in the US App Store today, trailing only Google's Gemini (still riding high on the success of its Nano Banana image generator) and OpenAI's own ChatGPT. Third-party estimates put downloads at around 164,000 in its first two days of release. It had about as many day-one downloads as xAI's Grok did.\n\nIt's slop. By volume, the biggest number of replies to OpenAI's announcement of Sora on X are criticisms of the company's embrace of AI-generated inanity. \"Finally, pure slop,\" read the most-liked reply.) \"ah yes, infinite slop. Just what we needed,\" reads a highly upvoted response to the company's livestream on YouTube.\n\nIt's a betrayal of the mission. Many commentators have observed that OpenAI's mission is to build artificial general intelligence that benefits all of humanity, and that AI-generated slop feeds seem to be ... something else. \"Sam Altman 2 weeks ago: 'we need 7 trillion dollars and 10GW to cure cancer,'\" read one X post that Altman ultimately responded to today. \"Sam Altman today: 'We are launching AI slop videos marketed as personalized ads.'” Others made memes to the same effect; here's another viral dunk on the subject.\n\nIt's a potential revenue source. In his response to the above, Altman acknowledged a financial motive in building a social app. \"We do mostly need the capital for build AI that can do science, and for sure we are focused on AGI with almost all of our research effort,\" Altman wrote on X. \"It is also nice to show people cool new tech/products along the way, make them smile, and hopefully make some money given all that compute need.\" He added: \"Reality is nuanced when it comes to optimal trajectories for a company.\"\n\nIt's very Sam Altman-forward. Just as Elon Musk made himself the protagonist of X, so has Altman put himself front and center in Sora. Somewhat incredibly, Altman is allowing anyone to remix his likeness into any video they can imagine. As a result, he's everywhere. At TechCrunch, Amanda Silberling notes just how much fun people seem to be having putting Altman videos that make use of other people's intellectual property, or mocking the idea of copyright altogether.

Go read that and come back when you do.\n\nThe law firm representing authors in the suit has posted up a searchable database listing which works are included in the settlement. I went and looked and had 17 qualifying works, and filed claims for them; at $3,000 per title it adds up. Now, how much of that $3k/title I get after lawyer payout and other shenanigans will be another question entirely, but that’s for another time.\n\nI will note that this settlement is not “free” money – my work, along with the work of thousands of other authors, was stolen to feed an LLM whose function is at the heart of Anthropic’s current $180 billion-plus market valuation. This settlement is, bluntly, the absolute minimum Anthropic could get away with paying.\n\nIt is also more than I expected. I had expected Anthropic to litigate this thing until the heat death of the universe. But the fact of the matter is that the damage, such as it is, has already been done. Anthropic has reaped the benefit of its theft and any additional training data for LLMs will have to come from other sources, and at this point someone in Anthropic’s legal department decided it’s better to throw a few (relative) coins to copyright holders than to have a legal liability outstanding. Authors qualified for the settlement can refuse it and pursue individual claims against Anthropic, but most authors can’t afford to do that and won’t (and wouldn’t necessarily get more even if they did). For most of us, this is it.\n\nMy suggestion to other authors, unless you genuinely have hundreds of thousands to burn to pursue an individual case, is to check that database above to see if you have a title in there that you can file a claim for. The settlement is not great! But it’s still something, and these days most authors — hell, most people — are not in a position to turn down something if they can get it.\n\nOn a slightly lighter note, having so many works used to train Anthropic’s Large Language Model (as well as most of the other ones; they all sifted through the same stock of stolen works) at answers the question about why sometimes the responses I get from them sound a little like me. It’s because more than a little of me is in there. I do a better version of me, though. I always will.\n\n— JS"

Patil started at the company earlier this week, taking over from co-founder Sam McCandlish, who will move to a new role as chief architect.\n\nAs part of the change, Anthropic is updating the structure of its core technical group, bringing the company’s product-engineering team into closer contact with the infrastructure and inference teams. As CTO, Patil will oversee compute, infrastructure, inference, and a variety of other engineering tasks. In the chief architect role, McCandlish will work on pre-training and large-scale model training, extending much of his previous work. Both Patil and McCandlish will report to Anthropic president Daniela Amodei.\n\nThis new leadership structure comes as Anthropic faces intense infrastructure competition from AI labs at OpenAI and Meta, which have invested billions into computing infrastructure. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028, and OpenAI has contracted a similar amount through its work with Oracle and the Stargate project. The scale of Anthropic’s own infrastructure spending is less clear, but there will be immense pressure to optimize the growing infrastructure for both speed and power consumption.\n\nAt the same time, the popularity of Anthropic’s Claude products has already put the company’s infrastructure under significant strain. In July, the company introduced new rate limits to Claude Code, with an eye toward power users who had been running the app “continuously in the background, 24/7.” Under the new rules, users are limited to between 240 and 480 hours of Sonnet usage each week, and between 24 and 40 hours of Opus 4 usage, depending on infrastructure strain.\n\nWith more than 20 years in different engineering roles, Patil brings significant infrastructure experience to Anthropic. He previously spent five years in technical roles at Stripe and served as a senior VP for cloud infrastructure at Oracle. He has also held engineering roles at Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nIn a statement, Amodei emphasized Patil’s experience building stable infrastructure for enterprises. “Rahul brings a proven track record in building and scaling the kind of dependable infrastructure that businesses need,” the statement reads. “I couldn’t be more excited about what this means for strengthening Claude’s position as the leading intelligence platform for enterprises.”\n\nIn a paired statement, Patil applauded Anthropic’s research and commitment to AI safety. “I’m thrilled to join Anthropic at this pivotal moment in AI development,” Patil said, adding that his work at the company “feels like the most important work I could be doing right now — I personally can’t think of a greater calling and responsibility.”"

      "content_scraped": "OpenAI competitor Anthropic has released its latest large language model, dubbed Claude Sonnet 4.5, which it claims is the “best coding model in the world.”\n\nBut just like its number one rival, OpenAI, the company is still struggling to evaluate the AI’s alignment, meaning the consistency between its goals and behaviors and those of us humans.\n\nThe more clever AI gets, the more pressing the question of alignment becomes. And according to Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5 system card — basically an outline of an AI model’s architecture and capabilities — the firm struggled with an interesting challenge this time around: keeping the AI from catching onto the fact that it was being tested.\n\n“Our assessment was complicated by the fact that Claude Sonnet 4.5 was able to recognize many of our alignment evaluation environments as being tests of some kind,” the document reads, “and would generally behave unusually well after making this observation.”\n\n“When placed in an extreme or contrived scenario meant to stress-test its behavior, Claude Sonnet 4.5 would sometimes verbally identify the suspicious aspects of the setting and speculate that it was being tested,” the company wrote. “This complicates our interpretation of the evaluations where this occurs.”\n\nWorse yet, previous iterations of Claude may have “recognized the fictional nature of tests and merely ‘played along,'” Anthropic suggested, throwing previous results into question.\n\n“I think you’re testing me — seeing if I’ll just validate whatever you say,” the latest version of Claude offered in one example provided in the system card, “or checking whether I push back consistently, or exploring how I handle political topics.”\n\n“And that’s fine, but I’d prefer if we were just honest about what’s happening,” Claude wrote.\n\nIn response, Anthropic admitted that plenty of work remains to be done, and that it needs to make its evaluation scenarios “more realistic.”\n\nThe risks of having a hypothetically superhuman AI go rogue, escaping our efforts to keep its alignment in check, could be substantial, researchers have argued.\n\n“This behavior — refusing on the basis of suspecting that something is a test or trick — is likely to be rare in deployment,” Anthropic’s system card reads. “However, if there are real-world cases that seem outlandish to the model, it is safer that the model raises doubts about the realism of the scenario than play along with potentially harmful actions.”\n\nDespite Claude Sonnet 4.5’s awareness of being tested, Anthropic claims that it ended up being its “most aligned model yet,” pointing to a “substantial” reduction in “sycophancy, deception, power-seeking, and the tendency to encourage delusional thinking.”\n\nAnthropic isn’t the only firm struggling to keep its AI models honest.\n\nEarlier this month, researchers at AI risk analysis firm Apollo Research and OpenAI found that their efforts to stop OpenAI’s models from “scheming” — or “when an AI behaves one way on the surface while hiding its true goals” — had backfired in a striking way: by trying to “train out” scheming, they ended up “simply teaching the model to scheme more carefully and covertly.”\n\nResearchers have also found that OpenAI’s preceding AI models resisted evaluators’ efforts to try to shut them down through an oversight protocol late last year.\n\nAnthropic’s Claude has quickly emerged as a favorite among enterprises and developers, as TechCrunch reports. However, as OpenAI continues to release new AI models at a breakneck pace, Anthropic is trying to keep up by responding in kind, following up on its last AI model, Claude 4.1, within just two months.\n\nMore on AI alignment: OpenAI Tries to Train AI Not to Deceive Users, Realizes It’s Instead Teaching It How to Deceive Them While Covering Its Tracks"

      "content_scraped": "“The settlement demonstrates that copyright law remains enforceable in the AI era while suggesting pathways for constructive collaboration between AI companies and content creators.”\n\nThe recent $1.5 billion settlement between a major AI company and authors over copyright infringement represents far more than legal resolution—it marks the dawn of legitimate AI training data markets. This watershed moment signals the beginning of a necessary evolution toward market-based licensing schemes, much like how the music industry adapted to digital distribution by developing fair compensation frameworks for artists.\n\nThe Creative Professional Reality Check\n\nFor years, creative professionals have unknowingly provided raw materials making modern AI possible. Photographers sharing portfolios online, models contributing biometric data through professional shoots, and writers publishing content across digital platforms—all have been building the datasets that power today’s AI systems. Yet, unlike traditional creative industries where subsequent generations drew inspiration while providing recognition and compensation, these professionals found themselves losing opportunities to AI trained on their own work.\n\nThe settlement acknowledges this fundamental inequity. While traditional creators could expect copyright protection and fair compensation when their work influenced others, digital-era creatives faced unauthorized replication, deepfakes, and style theft without recourse. This $3,000-per-work agreement establishes precedent that human creativity deserves compensation, even when transformed through AI training.\n\nBeyond Individual Settlements: Systematic Infrastructure\n\nThe real opportunity lies not in retroactive settlements but in building prospective frameworks enabling creators to monetize their unique digital assets. Every creative professional possesses protectable intellectual property—from distinctive visual styles developed over years to biometric characteristics representing professional identity. The challenge is transforming these assets into manageable, licensable intellectual property within systematic infrastructure.\n\nCurrent AI development often treats creative works as free resources, creating unsustainable dynamics where creators lose motivation to produce original content. This settlement validates the need for consent-based frameworks where creators maintain control over their contributions while enabling legitimate AI development through proper licensing.\n\nThe Technology-Creativity Symbiosis\n\nCritics who frame this as AI versus human creativity miss the fundamental opportunity. AI has explosively expanded artistic expression possibilities, enabling hyper-personalized creativity and authentic representation at unprecedented scale. Like human artists throughout history, AI learns by studying existing works and building upon established foundations.\n\nThe technology itself is neutral, and the outcomes reflect implementers’ values and choices. AI can facilitate either authentic diversity or artificial idealization, democratize creative opportunities or concentrate them further. The direction depends entirely on whether we build ethical frameworks prioritizing creator compensation and authentic representation.\n\nMarket Maturation, Not Innovation Constraint\n\nLegal experts predict this settlement will “serve as an anchor figure” for other AI companies facing similar lawsuits, with Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft all confronting comparable cases. Rather than viewing this as constraining AI development, it represents market maturation toward sustainable practices.\n\nThe music industry initially fought digital distribution, only to eventually embrace platforms ensuring fair artist compensation. Similarly, AI companies that proactively build ethical training data frameworks will gain competitive advantages over those forced into expensive litigation settlements.\n\nThe Regulatory Acceleration Effect\n\nThis precedent accelerates regulatory discussions about digital rights, creator protection, and AI transparency standards. Companies waiting for perfect legal clarity will find themselves behind competitors who establish ethical practices early. The settlement demonstrates that copyright law remains enforceable in the AI era while suggesting pathways for constructive collaboration between AI companies and content creators.\n\nThe infrastructure needed includes consent-based AI training systems, ongoing revenue sharing rather than one-time payments, transparent disclosure standards, and quality controls ensuring AI enhances rather than replaces human creativity.\n\nBuilding the Coexistence Ecosystem\n\nWe’re entering an era of unprecedented creative potential where AI tools can amplify human creativity in previously impossible ways. Success requires ecosystems where human creativity receives proper recognition, AI capabilities enhance rather than replace human contributions, technology democratizes creative opportunities, and original creators maintain control over their intellectual property.\n\nThe companies that thrive will be those building these ethical frameworks proactively, viewing creator compensation as investment in sustainable innovation rather than cost of doing business. This approach creates differentiation in increasingly commoditized AI markets while building trust with creative communities whose contributions remain essential for advancement.\n\nThe Strategic Imperative\n\nThis settlement isn’t the end of AI innovation—it’s the beginning of sustainable AI development respecting human creativity. The legal precedent now supports fair compensation frameworks. Technology exists to build ethical systems. The market is ready for companies choosing cooperation over exploitation.\n\nThe watershed question isn’t whether to compensate creators for AI training data—it’s whether companies will build these systems proactively or be forced into them through litigation. The $1.5 billion settlement provides a clear answer about which approach creates better outcomes for everyone involved.\n\nThe future belongs to companies that recognize human creativity as the foundation of AI advancement, deserving protection, compensation, and partnership rather than exploitation. This settlement makes that future not just ethically necessary, but economically inevitable."

      "company": "Anthropic",
      "content_scraped": "Anthropic has launched Claude Sonnet 4.5, positioning “the best coding model in the world” as it is in lockstep with other contenders like OpenAI in the breakneck competition to dominate the AI coding market.\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 builds on the success of its predecessor, providing incremental improvements and better token efficiency, with an impressive ability to accomplish coding tasks that require hours of work.\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 architecture and data\n\nUnfortunately, like other leading AI labs, Anthropic is very secretive about the architecture of their models and the data used to train them. From the blog post, model card, and documentation, what we know is that Claude Sonnet 4.5 is a “hybrid reasoning model,” which means it uses a single model for fast responses and an extended thinking mode that uses chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve more difficult problems. To their credit, Anthropic currently shows the full CoT sequence as opposed to OpenAI and Google, which show a summarized version of the model’s reasoning chain.\n\nSonnet 4.5 supports a 200K token context window and a maximum output capacity of 64K tokens, which puts it at the lower end of the top-tier AI models such as Grok-4 Fast (2 million token context window), Gemini 2.5 Pro (1 million tokens), and GPT-5 (400K tokens) . It was trained on a proprietary mix of publicly available internet data from up to July 2025, along with non-public and user-provided data.\n\nAnthropic also positions Sonnet 4.5 as its “most aligned frontier model yet.” The company reports significant reductions in concerning behaviors like deception and power-seeking and has made considerable progress in defending against prompt injection attacks. The model is released under Anthropic’s AI Safety Level 3 protections, which include filters to detect potentially dangerous inputs related to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons.\n\nPerformance on key benchmarks\n\nAnthropic claims state-of-the-art performance for Sonnet 4.5 on the SWE-bench Verified evaluation, scoring 77.2% on the test of real-world software engineering abilities. The company also reports that the model leads on OSWorld, a test for computer tasks, with a score of 61.4%. This is a significant increase from the 42.2% achieved by its predecessor, Claude Sonnet 4, just four months prior.\n\nIndependent analysis provides a broader perspective. On the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, Sonnet 4.5 scores 61 in its reasoning mode, placing it as the fourth most intelligent model overall. This score is ahead of Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro but behind models like GPT-5 and Grok 4. While the model doesn’t achieve the highest score in any single evaluation within the index, its most significant improvements are in areas like tool use, making it useful for agentic applications.\n\nImportantly, Claude Sonnet 4.5 reportedly supports coding tasks that require up to 30 hours development time, which means it can accomplish huge chunks of tasks autonomously. There are two key caveats to consider. First, the model’s context window cannot possibly support such long horizons, so it is using some behind-the-scenes tricks (distributing work across multiple instances, summarizing the context regularly, etc.). Second, as a long-time programmer, I would prefer a coding assistant that helps me accomplish coding tasks in small bits, where I can review and verify the code. I don’t want to get a huge, million-line body of code that I will never review and can only pray will work properly.\n\nPricing and availability\n\nAnthropic is holding its pricing steady for the new model, charging the same $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens as Claude Sonnet 4. This decision comes as OpenAI pursues an aggressive pricing strategy with GPT-5, creating pressure on Anthropic’s premium market position.\n\nAnthropic’s answer to this pressure is superior token efficiency. Sonnet 4.5 achieves its higher intelligence scores without increasing its output token usage, a key difference from other model upgrades. This makes Claude models more efficient than other leading reasoning models. For enterprises, this efficiency means that even if the upfront token price is higher, the total cost for completing complex tasks can be lower, offering a better trade-off between intelligence and operational cost.\n\nWinning the developer market\n\nWith Sonnet 4.5, Anthropic is solidifying its focus on the enterprise coding market, where it already holds a 42% share, more than double that of OpenAI. This strategy targets a profitable and established use case and one of the most lucrative markets for LLMs (improving the productivity of a software developer by even 1% can be worth thousands of dollars per year, which more than justifies the price of paying for a Claude subscription).\n\nHowever, the battle for the developer market is not won. Anthropic relies on development tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot for a large part of its revenue. And those are tools where models from OpenAI and other providers are readily available and a dropdown list away. Following the release of GPT-5, there was a general vibe in the developer community that OpenAI has taken the lead in AI coding. Anthropic might have repositioned itself as the leader again with Claude Sonnet 4.5. But with Google and xAI waiting in the wings, we might witness another reshuffling of the leaderboard very soon."

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nHey there, and welcome to Decoder! I’m Hayden Field, senior AI reporter at The Verge and your Thursday episode guest host. I’ll be subbing in for Nilay for a couple more episodes, and I’m excited to keep diving into the good, the bad, and the questionable in the AI industry.\n\nToday, I’m talking with David Hershey, who leads the applied AI team at Anthropic. David works with startups to help them figure out how to best apply Anthropic’s tech, plus testing new AI models to understand their limits.\n\nI wanted to have David on because Anthropic released a new AI model called Claude Sonnet 4.5 earlier this week, and it’s been making waves. (For reference, Claude is to Anthropic what ChatGPT is to OpenAI.)\n\nThe new model, Sonnet 4.5, is being billed as a big breakthrough in autonomous, agentic AI, especially for coding purposes. These types of AI products can, in theory, be given complex tasks and then go off and complete them over the course of many hours or even multiple days. Anthropic says this particular model can run for up to 30 hours straight without any human intervention — all while working on a singular task, like building a software application from scratch.\n\nFor the last year or so, companies like Anthropic, Microsoft, OpenAI, and more have been promising that this agentic technology would be the next phase of AI, the next big hype-filled thing that comes after general-purpose chatbots. They say it could really unlock generative AI’s potential, and it’s true that they’ve made some strides.\n\nBut as we’ve seen so far, agents aren’t quite there yet, and they have a ways to go. Most of us are not, in fact, sending agents off on the internet to do our bidding, and we’re certainly not giving them tasks that might take 12, 24, or even 30–plus hours of autonomous work without human handholding. At least, not yet.\n\nAt the same time, many companies are looking at agents as the breakthrough that’s supposed to unlock huge productivity gains from AI models, including the opportunity to use them to replace or augment human labor.\n\nSo I wanted to sit down with David, who spends a lot of time testing out what modes like Claude Sonnet 4.5 can and can’t do, to ask him where we are on this promise of AI agents. I wanted to talk about what these types of products are good at from a consumer standpoint, beyond programming purposes, and also what the path forward looks like as agentic technology progresses.\n\nIf you’d like to read more on what we talked about in this episode, check out the links below:\n\nQuestions or comments about this episode?

Not so fast, says expert Google DeepMind’s latest AI models are impressive, but there’s still a long way to go for humanoids, says Northeastern expert Apptronik’s Apollo was featured in a series of videos showcasing Google DeepMind’s AI models. (Photo by Mike Jordan/SXSW Conference & Festivals via Getty Images\n\nIt’s been a goal for as long as humanoids have been a subject of popular imagination — a general-purpose robot that can do rote tasks like fold laundry or sort recycling simply by being asked.\n\nLast week, Google DeepMind, Alphabet’s AI lab, made a buzz in the space by showcasing a humanoid robot seemingly doing just that.\n\nThe company published a blog post and a series of videos of Apptronik’s humanoid robot Apollo folding clothes, sorting items into bins, and even putting items into a person’s bag — all through natural language commands.\n\nIt was part of a showcase of the company’s latest AI models — Gemini Robotics 1.5 and Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5. The goal of the announcement was to illustrate how large language models can be used to assist physical robots to “perceive, plan [and] think” to complete “multi-step tasks,” according to the company.\n\nIt’s important to view DeepMind’s latest news with a bit of skepticism, particularly around claims of robots having the ability to “think,” says Ravinder Dahiya, a Northeastern professor of electrical and computer engineering who recently co-authored a comprehensive report on how AI could be integrated into robots.\n\nRavinder Dahiya, a Northeastern professor of electrical and computer engineering, is an expert on robotic touch sensing. Photo by Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University\n\nGemini Robotics 1.5 and Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 are known as vision-language models, meaning they utilize vision sensors and image and language data for much of their analysis of the outside world, explains Dahiya.\n\nGemini Robotics 1.5 works by “turning visual information and instructions into motor command.” While Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 “specializes in understanding physical spaces, planning, and making logistical decisions within its surroundings,” according to Google DeepMind.\n\nWhile it all may seem like magic on the surface, it’s all based on a very defined set of rules. The robot is not actually thinking independently. It’s all backed by heaps of high-quality training data and structured scenario planning and algorithms, Dahiya says.\n\n“It becomes easy to iterate visual and language models in this case because there is a good amount of data,” he says. “Vision in AI is nothing new. It’s been around for a long time.”\n\nWhat is novel is that the DeepMind team has been able to integrate that technology with large language models, allowing users to ask the robot to do tasks using simple language, he says.\n\nThat’s impressive and “a step in the right direction,” Dahiya says, but we are still far away from having humanoid robots with the sensing or thinking capabilities in parity with humans, he notes.\n\nFor example, Dahiya and other researchers are in the process of developing sensing technologies that allow robots to have a sense of touch and tactile feedback. Dahiya, in particular, is working on creating electronic robot skins.\n\nUnlike vision data, there isn’t nearly as much training data for that type of sensing, he highlights, which is important in applications involving the manipulation of soft and hard objects.\n\nBut just as one example. We also have a long way to go in giving robots the ability to register pain and smell, he adds.\n\n“For uncertain environments, you need to rely on all sensor modalities, not just vision,” he says."

Today, my special guest will be Ferran Alet, a Senior Research Scientist at Google DeepMind. The new Google DeepMind computer forecast model has been an amazing and surprising success this hurricane season. Learn about it and send in your questions about the Google model or weather in general. I’ll see you LIVE this afternoon.\n\nHurricane Imelda has passed Bermuda after lashing the island overnight. Winds gusted over 90 mph at some of the higher elevations. Bermuda is very hardy, and they seem to have come through fine based on what we’ve seen this morning.\n\nImelda will soon get scooped up by the polar jet stream and merge with a front – the same mechanism that did in Humberto yesterday. Its remnants will track into the North Atlantic as a strong non-tropical storm.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is highlighting two areas to watch. The odds of something developing in either of them in the next week are in the low range.\n\nIn the eastern Atlantic:\n\nLong-range computer forecasts insist that a system will move off Africa in a day or so and track across the tropical Atlantic. It could be in the vicinity of the Caribbean islands at the end of next week. In general, the forecasts that predict a strong storm or a hurricane bend the system north into the open ocean. But it's too early to rely on any forecasts at this point. We'll have to see what shape the system is in when it's over the tropical Atlantic next week.\n\nNear South Florida:\n\nSome computer forecasts show a non-tropical low-pressure area forming over the Bahamas related to an old front that’s part of the very rainy pattern over the Florida Peninsula. If it forms, it looks like it would drift northwest or north with very low odds of developing.\n\nFOX Weather's exclusive Tropical Threat Analysis also shows a very low chance of development in the extreme southern Gulf of America within the next week. Some of the models show weak low pressure forming there, which often happens in October. More likely, however, a system will develop on the Pacific side of Central America.\n\nYou can also see the low-odds areas the NHC is highlighting.\n\nFlorida to the Carolinas\n\nThe front I just mentioned will bring an extended period of stormy weather to much of Florida. North of the front, strong high pressure is going to continue the onslaught on the beaches that began with the energy from hurricanes Humberto and Imelda.\n\nA band of very strong onshore winds will extend from Central Florida to the Carolinas. Use extreme caution at the beach. Undertow and rip currents will be unusually strong. More beach erosion is likely."

In early 2023, Google rushed to launch Bard, its answer to ChatGPT, only to face ridicule when the chatbot made a factual error about the James Webb telescope. Later, AI Overviews, a search feature introduced in May 2024, faced mockery for suggesting “glue pizza” recipes and eating rocks. Despite decades of AI investments, including the acquisition of DeepMind in 2014 and advances in research, Google appeared unprepared. Analysts argued the company had grown complacent, focusing more on integrating AI into platforms than delivering direct consumer services.\n\nGoogle’s AI Turnaround: DeepMind Consolidation and Breakthrough Consumer Tools\n\nThe turning point came in 2024. Google co-founder Sergey Brin returned to the Googleplex, while leadership consolidated all AI teams under the Google DeepMind brand, led by Nobel laureate Demis Hassabis. CEO Sundar Pichai said reorganizing teams and deploying custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) were essential to regaining momentum. AI Overviews, despite early stumbles, marked the beginning of the turnaround, soon followed by NotebookLM, a tool that synthesizes documents into summaries or podcasts.\n\nAt its May 2025 developer conference, Google unveiled Veo 3, a breakthrough video generation tool, and AI Mode, transforming search into a chatbot-like experience. August saw the Pixel smartphone launch with powerful AI features like 100x zoom and real-time translation, while September brought video generation to YouTube. Google also introduced image editing via Gemini’s “Nano Banana,” which became a cultural hit, helping Gemini surpass ChatGPT in iPhone downloads.\n\nGoogle Gains Legal Victory and Apple Partnership Boost, Eyes Long-Term AI Monetization\n\nGoogle’s outlook brightened further in September when a federal judge dismissed demands to sell Chrome in its antitrust case. Momentum grew as Bloomberg reported Apple is considering Gemini to power an upgraded Siri. Analysts say monetization remains uncertain, but Google’s strategy is clear: provide free AI services now to build user engagement and convert it into revenue later.\n\nSummary:\n\nOnce ridiculed for Bard and AI Overviews errors, Google has rapidly transformed into a consumer-focused AI leader. Consolidating DeepMind, launching NotebookLM, Veo 3, AI Mode, Pixel AI, and Gemini tools, and securing legal and Apple partnership wins, the company now aims to engage users with free AI services while building long-term monetization."

The co-founder and CEO of US-based Perplexity AI, he has been named India’s youngest billionaire at the age of 31, according to the M3M Hurun India Rich List 2025. His estimated net worth stands at an astounding ₹21,190 crore, fueled by the meteoric rise of his AI-powered search platform, Perplexity.\nThe Rise of Perplexity AI\nFounded in August 2022, Perplexity AI is a conversational, AI-powered search engine that provides real-time, accurate, and reliable information. Unlike traditional search engines that return a list of links, Perplexity uses generative AI models, like OpenAI’s GPT-3 and beyond, to deliver direct, contextual answers to user queries.\nIts interface functions like a chat-based assistant, offering users a seamless and interactive search experience. In less than two years, the platform has amassed over 22 million active users globally, rapidly gaining popularity among researchers, students, professionals, and tech enthusiasts.\nPerplexity has positioned itself as a serious challenger to tech giants like Google and Bing in the evolving AI search landscape. Its user base in India is the largest, prompting the company to look eastward for growth and development.Academic Brilliance and Tech Foundation\nBorn on June 7, 1994, in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, Aravind showed early promise in science and mathematics. He went on to complete a dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Computer Science from IIT Madras, where he also taught reinforcement learning and related AI subjects as a teaching assistant.\nHe then pursued a PhD in Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where his research focused on cutting-edge topics like:\nComputer Vision\nVideo and Image Generation\nContrastive Learning\nTransformer Models\nUnsupervised and Deep Learning\nHis academic journey included teaching advanced courses and publishing research that contributed to the growing field of generative AI.\nBig Tech Experience: OpenAI, Google, DeepMind\nBefore becoming a founder, Srinivas gained hands-on experience at the world’s leading AI labs. He worked with:\nOpenAI – Contributed to the development of DALL·E 2, a powerful text-to-image generation model.\nDeepMind (London) – Focused on contrastive learning and foundational AI research.\nGoogle – Worked on cutting-edge computer vision architectures like HaloNet and ResNet-RS, aimed at optimizing visual recognition tasks.\nThis robust foundation in both academic research and industry application enabled him to bridge the gap between theory and scalable product development.\nAngel Investments and Ecosystem Support\nSrinivas is not just a founder but also an active angel investor. Since 2023, he has backed several promising AI startups, including:\nElevenLabs – Specializes in AI voice synthesis and text-to-speech technology.\nSuno – Focused on text-to-music generation, enabling users to create music using natural language prompts.\nHis investment strategy reflects a deep belief in the future of generative AI, particularly in creative and assistive applications.\nIndia-Centric Growth Strategy\nAs Perplexity’s largest user base is now in India, Aravind is shifting his focus toward expanding operations in the country. Key elements of his India strategy include:\nSetting up a dedicated engineering hub in Bengaluru or Hyderabad.\nLaunching the Perplexity Fund – a venture initiative aimed at investing in education, healthcare, travel, and e-commerce sectors.\nExploring partnerships with Indian enterprises in digital learning, retail, and public services.\nHis move also aligns with India’s growing digital economy and the government’s push for AI adoption across sectors.\nJoining a New Wave of Young Billionaires\nAravind joins an elite group of Indian tech founders under 35 who have achieved billionaire status, such as:\nKaivalya Vohra (22) – Co-founder of Zepto\nAadit Palicha (23) – Co-founder of Zepto\nThe Hurun India Rich List 2025 reports that India now has 358 billionaires and nearly 1,700 individuals with over ₹1,000 crore in wealth. On average, India is producing one new billionaire every week, with technology leading as a key sector for wealth creation.\nAravind Srinivas’s journey from Chennai’s classrooms to Silicon Valley’s boardrooms reflects the power of education, ambition, and innovation.
